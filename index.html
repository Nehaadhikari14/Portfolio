                                experience, takeout and delivery and also online reservations etc.There

                                interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, 
                                subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator is a practical 
                                tool and serves as an excellent example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                                can work together.</a>
